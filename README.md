Feature extraction and Text pre-processing
Machines cannot understand English or any text data by default. The text data needs a special preparation before you can give text data to the machine to predict something out of it. That special preparation includes several steps such as removing stops words, correcting spelling mistakes, removing meaningless words, removing rare words and many more.
The first step of preparing text data is applying feature extraction and basic text pre-processing. In feature extraction and basic text pre-processing there several steps as follows,

1.Removing Punctuations
2.Removing HTML tags
3.Special Characters removal
4.Removing Alphanumeric words
5.Tokenization
6.Removal of Stop words
7.Lower casing
8.Lemmatization
